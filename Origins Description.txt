[i]For 10000 years, two ancient empires lay in ruins, forgotten while the galaxy moved on. But survivors of these mighty civilizations may yet sprout from the ashes of the Great Crusade and reclaim their place once more among the stars. Whether their return is wholly welcome, however, depends upon you... Will you follow your ancestors' path once more that led them to their ruin? Only time will tell.[/i]
