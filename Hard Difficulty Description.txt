[i]For many years, the Precursor Empires have wondered the logic behind the many upstarts who rose to challenge their might, only to surrender immediately and accept utter humiliation and their leader killed. Have they truly learned their lesson? Why are they back again? But as time goes on, the primitive's true, insidious intentions have been brought to light, and the Precursor Empires have decreed this shall pass no more. Their defenses have been bolstered, as a matter of national security against the inevitable onslaught of technological theft that is sure to come.[/i]


The Zenith of Fallen Empires: Hard Difficulty is designed for players who are interested in a slightly more challenging Zenith of Fallen Empire experience, by introducing newmodifiers for Fallen Empires, End Game Crises, Leviathans, and Marauders. This should be compatible with every mod out there, since it's only a few modifiers, but any mod that already buff Fallen Empires, Crises, Leviathans and Marauders will now be even stronger, perhaps worthy challenges for a new Ascended Empire.

It is worth noting that the modifiers introduced in this mod are exactly half that of the Veteran Difficulty, but maybe combined in use with Veteran Difficulty to create a 'Nightmare Difficulty' :D. Also, Fallen Empires no longer start with an extra fleet as is in Veteran.
