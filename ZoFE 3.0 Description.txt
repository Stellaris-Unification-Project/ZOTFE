[i]They were promising once. The big-eyed, fluffy primitives that pleased our ancestors were uplifted, in hopes they would contribute to galactic community that we built. But all things must end. Our ancestors were deceived. For centuries, they spied on us, stole from us. Our technologies, our secrets, taken with scant regard for the elders who brought those advances to our society. And now they proclaim themselves an Ascended Empire, one that will span millennia using our technologies to serve their twisted ideals. Wasting no time, they quickly converted half the galaxy to their cause. How long they have conspired and waited for this moment. As the titan foundries roar to life, and our once dormant shipyards rumble, our people unite once more against the monsters we created. The prophets foresaw the traitors¡¦ demise ¡V let us hope that they were right.[/i]
