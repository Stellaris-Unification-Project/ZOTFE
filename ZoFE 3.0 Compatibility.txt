Mod Compatibility:

Compatibility is a very, dirty word which encompasses all sorts of meaning to all sorts of people. Here I will attempt to describe its various meanings like a spectrum, and what exactly will happen if ZoFE 3.0 is used with X mod. This is my spectrum of compatibility:

Compatible: These mods work really well together!
Supported: These mods have slight synergies with each other, since I play them myself.
Unsupported: These mods don’t interact with each other in any meaningful way, and largely functions independently of each other.
Polish: There may be duplicate buildings, coloured boxes, technologies that do the same thing, or feature clash. You can still play these together if polish isn’t a major concern. A patch may be considered for a smoother experience.
Requires Patch: These mods unfortunately overwrite the same files, and requires a compatibility patch to take into account both values.
Incompatible: Expect crashes to desktop.

Care has been taken to minimize instances of ‘Incompatible’ and ‘Requires Patch’ during the design and creation of the Zenith of Fallen Empires 3.0 base mod, and it is always a trade-off between adding more features or more compatibility. To further increase compatibility, content that may have additional compatibility issues have been put into their own submod, which is also how 2.0 dealt with the issue of compatibility. Of course, 100% compatibility means a mod with no gameplay features :D. Still, I hope the end result will be an acceptable trade-off for most.

Gigastructure Engineering: Unsupported.
Planetary Diversity: Unsupported. Requires Patch with Utopian add-on.
Tactical ship sections: Unsupported.
New Ship Classes: Unsupported. Polish if player chooses Branch 3 of the ZoFE chain.
Downscaled Ships: Requires Patch
