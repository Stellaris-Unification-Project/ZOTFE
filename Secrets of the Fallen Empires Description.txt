[i]Time has not been kind to the Fallen Empires. Centuries before, their civilizations shined like beacons in the dark, and they were the envy of primitives and savages. In the end, not even their greatest advances and innovations survived the passing of time. Time is the ultimate judge of civilizations. But what if there is a way to undo the damage time has caused? What if we can piece together what little information that remained, so the greatest inventions of the past can come to life once more? Many secrets lay buried within the artifacts we gathered, often referring to technologies which have since been lost. The legends of these lost technologies and their feats however, remain a popular discussion for our scientific community, and their mythical existence still hotly debated to this day...[/i]

The Zenith of Fallen Empires: Secrets of the Fallen Empires submod expands upon the Lost Technologies mechanic introduced in 'Automated Industries', by introducing around 20 new Lost Technologies for the player to uncover, including new weapons/ship components, Goliath shipclass, and Original Escorts, Battlecruisers, and Fallen Titan ship sections.
