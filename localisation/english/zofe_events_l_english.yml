 zofe.1.name:0 "Precursor Power Source"
 zofe.1.desc:0 "For years, our scientists struggled to determine the exact source of power which distorts gravity so predictably that it can be used to power the precursor ships and their fancy buildings. Our scientists proposed an ambitious yet daring mission - by sending a science vessel to the precursor capital to observe and study it in secret. Any new findings on this power source could accelerate our progress, putting us far ahead of our rivals. Our research team will study in radio silence, and extra care will be taken to avoid detection by the precursor patrols. If discovered however, the consequences could be dire. Should we perform this risky operation to obtain the secrets of §HDark Matter Power§!?"
 zofe.1.a:0 "Do it."
 zofe.1.b:0 "We will do no such thing."
 
 DARK_MATTER_POWER_RESEARCH:0 "Precursor Power Source"
 DARK_MATTER_POWER_RESEARCH_DESC:0 "For years our scientists pondered the nature of this power source. Some theorized it could be Dark Matter, while others not so sure. In any case, this mission will get to the bottom of this mystery."
 
 zofe.100.name:0 "Precursor Expedition Concluded"
 zofe.100.desc:0 "After two years of skillful espionage, we have managed to obtain a sample of Dark Matter Power. This power source is indeed powerful, as the findings suggest. What's more, the precursor empire seemed none the wiser for it. We stole it from right underneath their noses."
 zofe.100.desc.02:0 "After two years of skillful espionage, our research team has published their findings detailing the workings of this Dark Matter Power. This power source is indeed powerful, but more research is needed in order for us to find some real application for this. What's more, the precursor empire seemed none the wiser for it. We stole it from right underneath their noses."
 zofe.100.desc.03:0 "After two years of skillful espionage, our research team has published their findings detailing their observations throughout this period. Unfortunately they were not able to bring back any useful information on how we could replicate this power for ourselves. Instead, the findings may prove useful in our other scientific researches."
 zofe.100.desc.04:0 "After two years of espionage, our research team met their end as the radio silence was broken by one of the team members, letting slip of their location. Precursor patrols quickly blasted our vessel out of the sky, along with all the research findings in it. Fortunately, the precursor empire did not understand the nature of our presence there and seemed disinterested to ask further questions."
 zofe.100.desc.05:0 "After two years of espionage, our research team met their end when they were spotted by one of the precursor patrols. They were blasted out of the sky and captured, along with the rest of their findings. After some interrogation, the precursor empire has learned of the nature of our presence there and demanded our government be held accountable for attempted theft. We may not hear the end of this just yet."
 zofe.100.a:0 "At last!"
 zofe.100.b:0 "Their secret shall be ours!"
 zofe.100.c:0 "Perhaps we're just not that bright..."
 zofe.100.d:0 "At least they aren't pursuing this further..."
 zofe.100.e:0 "Oh no."
 
 zofe.2.name:0 "Dark Matter Power"
 zofe.2.desc:0 "For years our scientists pondered over the possibilities of 'Dark Matter Power' and its potential application. A recent scientific breakthrough has finally enabled us to start research on this elusive source of power."
 zofe.2.a:0 "Good."
 
 zofe.200.name:0 "Dark Matter Power Breakthrough"
 zofe.200.desc:0 "Our intelligence report that there has been a recent scientific breakthrough in §H[From.GetName]§!. Reports suggest that they have begun research into the elusive Dark Matter Power and may soon find practical applications for this power source. The race is on."
 zofe.200.a:0 "Interesting."
 
 zofe.3.name:0 "Societal Decadence"
 zofe.3.desc:0 "Today's generation of §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! have never had it so good. The standard of living has never been higher, and many young §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! now grow up in laps of luxury, never experiencing hardship or real struggle. They are conceited, foolish, and have questionable work ethics, favoring of pleasure over work. They take for granted the nation that was built on the bodies of their ancestors, and feel complacent about their way of life, that nothing matters and nothing bad would ever happen. Some young §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! would go so far as to believe that the §H[Root.GetName]§! is invincible because the §H[Root.GetSpeciesAdj]§! race is inherently superior. That was the finding of §H[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]§! anyway, during a routine stroll through the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\nAnd that is worrying. The §H[Root.GetName]§! and the future of the §H[Root.GetSpeciesAdj]§! race cannot be assured when our young live in such decadence with no ambition or drive. To ensure our continued survival, campaigns must be fought at each generation to halt the spread of decadence and complacency, if our civilization is truly to last millennia."
 zofe.3.a:0 "We must re-double our efforts."

 zofe.4.desc:0 "A massive campaign is underway in the §H[From.GetName]§!.\n\nNews have spread of §H[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName]§!'s war on decadence, an issue that seems rife in §H[From.GetSpeciesAdj]§! society. If successful, §H[From.GetName]§! would surely return to the peak of their power, securing their ascendancy for a generation."
 zofe.4.a:0 "What will it mean for us?"
 
 zofe.6.name:0 "Conquest of [From.From.GetName]"
 zofe.6.desc:0 "We have wrested control over §H[From.From.GetName]§! from the ravenous swarm, and the fighting has finally settled down. Sadly, the original population of this plant had all been eaten by the galactic scourge.\n\nUntil new colonists arrive from somewhere, this world will remain devoid of intelligent life."
 zofe.6.a:0 "Withdraw our forces to orbit."
 
 zofe.12.name:0 "Dark Matter - Possibilities"
 zofe.12.desc:0 "Although we have the technologies necessary to harness §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! from space, we have yet to find any real uses for them as our knowledge of §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! remains limited.\n\nHowever, some of their special properties match our observations of precursor ships, which demonstrated propulsion behaviours that seem to defy the laws of physics - or at least, our current understanding of physics.\n\nDo the Fallen Empires know something about the application of §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! that we don't?"
 zofe.12.a:0 "Curious."
 
 zofe.13.name:0 "Dark Matter Power"
 zofe.13.desc:0 "From the many artifacts we have gathered over the years, combined with our observation data on Precursor ships and cities, we now know for certain that §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! can indeed be used as a source of power. Unfortunately, despite its potential, how this is achieved still puzzled the §H[Root.GetSpeciesAdj]§! scientific community at large. It is clear now, that in order to be elevated to the highest level of civilization, §Y$tech_dark_matter_power_core$§! plays a crucial role and must be achieved.\n\nOur science team offered two proposals as to how this could be done. First, we could conduct our own experiments, investing in new facilities with the goal of developing §Y$tech_dark_matter_power_core$§! indigenously. The second would involve breaking down the various artifacts we have gathered and analyse their secrets, looking for clues and perhaps even fragments of a §Y$tech_dark_matter_power_core$§!.\n\nThere is of course, a third option. Hawks in the military are always looking for ways of acquiring this technology through conflict. The final decision then, remains entirely up to §H[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]§!."
 zofe.13.a:0 "We should try to develop §Y$tech_dark_matter_power_core$§! ourselves."
 zofe.13.b:0 "We should look through the artifacts for answers."
 zofe.13.c:0 "We'll take §Y$tech_dark_matter_power_core$§! from the precursor's cold, dead hands."
 zofe.13.d:0 "Maybe the Ancient Archive can tell us something we don't know."
 
 zofe.131.name:0 "Properties Research Completed"
 zofe.131.desc:0 "In its harvested form, §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! is a substance that emit no light, disturbs magnetic fields, and exert gravitational pull on surrounding objects which, as our scientists noted, is completely useless in energy generation. But as the study went on, through a combination of trial and error, one scientist discover that §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! can in fact, be activated with the use of agent particles, making them far easier to work with.\n\nHowever, the activated §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! is short-lived in our environment, and our scientists would like more funding to continue their research."
 zofe.131.a:0 "If it is funding they want, then funding they shall receive."
 zofe.131.b:0 "They're not getting that funding!"
 
 zofe.132.name:0 "Reactor Design Completed"
 zofe.132.desc:0 "After overcoming several engineering dilemma, our scientists have managed to create a stable reactor in which activated §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! can be stored. There remain issues however: what use is activated §Y$sr_dark_matter$§!? One scientist propose that we could attempt to split activated §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! by firing particles at it to create fission, which we know can produce energy.\n\nDue to the extreme dangers of this next phase of the research, our scientists have requested yet more funding and insurance policies for their families."
 zofe.132.a:0 "Everyone has a price. Just get it done."
 zofe.132.b:0 "No, scientists are replaceable."
 
 zofe.133.name:0 "Dark Matter Fission Completed"
 zofe.133.desc:0 "As the moment of an activated §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! particle split, it released a blast so powerful that most of the instruments measuring energy output had malfunctioned. With further tests, our scientists believe they are on the verge of a breakthrough, and the secrets to unlocking §Y$tech_dark_matter_power_core$§! are finally within our grasp.\n\nNaturally, there is the issue of funding, which our scientists believe are conservative estimates of the extra contractors and operational costs of the next phase - building a prototype."
 zofe.133.a:0 "We will pay."
 zofe.133.b:0 "They're just going to have to do this out of their own pockets."
 
 zofe.134.name:0 "Prototype Completed"
 zofe.134.desc:0 "Our scientists are happy to report that after many years of research, a functional prototype of a §Y$tech_dark_matter_power_core$§! has been created.
