 titan_weapons.6.desc:0 "Our scientists have suspected for some time that the wall between our dimension and the next was weakening due to our use of the Portal Generator. Luckily, we managed to correct an equipment malfunction before whatever this...thing...is, crosses completely into our dimension. We should reevaluate our use of the weapon after sending this thing back where it came from."
