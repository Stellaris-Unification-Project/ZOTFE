[i]At the zenith of civilisation, citizens are united by a single, fanatical ideal. With their thunderous applause, our society will transform, unlocking new buildings for our Ascended Society, the dawn of a new age.[/i]

The Zenith of Fallen Empires: Societal Ascendance submod expands upon the second project of the Base Mod, 'Societal Ascendance', by introducing around 20 new ethic-based buildings to make your Ascended Empire feel more unique.
